## ðŸ“¦ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FastheDeveloper/Growify
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Note: To make it easier for you to test and run the app quickly, I've included the Supabase environment variables directly in the code.

## ðŸ§ª Run the App

To create a **development build** for Android:

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

For iOS (requires macOS + Xcode):

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

To run in Expo Go (for development/testing):

```bash
npx expo start
```

## ðŸš¡ Troubleshooting

- Make sure Android Studio and device/emulator are properly set up.
- If Tailwind classes donâ€™t apply, try restarting Metro bundler and clearing cache:

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
